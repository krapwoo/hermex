 * in CI to catch undocumented API changes, or handed to an LLM as ground truth for which props/
 * variants/states a component actually supports, instead of it guessing from the source alone.
 * Token-gallery sections (Colors, Spacing, …) are skipped — they document values, not a component
 * API. `render`-based sections (interactive demos with local state) keep their static `props`/
 * `a11y` metadata but naturally have no `variants`/`states` items to list, since those live inside
 * the render function rather than as data.
