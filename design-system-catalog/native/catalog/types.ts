   *  column is titled "States / Configurations" precisely because not everything that belongs here is
   *  a strict boolean toggle. Two rules, checked against the component's real prop interface (not just
   *  whichever states come to mind):
   *  1. **No real prop left undemonstrated** — every prop that visibly changes the component's look
   *     needs at least one instance somewhere in the section (here or in `variants`). A prop that
   *     only ever appears in the Props table, with no live example anywhere, is a documentation gap.
   *  2. **Show both sides of a toggle, not just the special one** — when a state is one half of a
   *     binary look (icon-only vs. icon+text, disabled vs. enabled, expanded vs. collapsed), include
   *     *both* instances here rather than assuming the reader will cross-reference `variants` for the
   *     baseline. The States / Configurations column should read on its own.
   *  3. **Duplication across columns is fine, and often correct** — don't withhold an instance from
   *     here merely because the same configuration already appears in `variants` (or vice versa). Each
   *     column should be independently complete: a reader looking only at States / Configurations
   *     shouldn't have to flip to Variants (or back) to see the full picture.
   *  4. **A continuous prop (`size: number`, a colour string, …) has no fixed enum to sweep — show an
   *     explicit small / medium / large (or similarly-spaced) trio anyway, and label the one that
   *     matches the component's own default as "Medium" or "Default", even if that same default
   *     value already appears, unlabeled, somewhere else in the section (e.g. an unsized instance in
   *     `variants`). An instance the reader can't identify as "this is what a smaller/larger one looks
   *     like" doesn't count as demonstrating the range — this is the same rule as #3, but continuous
   *     props are exactly where it's easiest to skip a middle value because "the default is shown
   *     elsewhere anyway."
   *  SectionBlock always renders a "States / Configurations" column; omit this and it shows "No
   *  additional states or configurations documented." instead of just not appearing. */
